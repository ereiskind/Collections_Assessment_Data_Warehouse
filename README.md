A program for performing collections assessment in academic libraries.

## Information on This Repository

### History
The development of this program did not begin in this repository; much of the project's previous content, including relevant aspects of the commit history, were moved to this repository as to create a repository suited for a Docker runtime enviroment and excluding all data from the developing institution.

### Runtime Enviroment
This repository is designed to be deployed a series of Docker containers. This repository will be pulled down into a Python Docker container and mingled with files containing private information located in the same directory as the Docker Compose file. More information about this runtime enviroment can be found in the Runtime_Enviroment folder.
