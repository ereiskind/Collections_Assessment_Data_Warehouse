# COUNTER Usage Statistics

## From the COUNTER Director in an Email List
"advice that we at COUNTER gave on 6 August 2019 about using an additional custom metric in the Master Reports to report the total number of chapters downloaded. This is not an amendment to the Code of Practice, but an extension as defined in section 11.4 of the Code of Practice. Clients like ERM and usage consolidation systems should be prepared to handle such custom values. Note that extensions are only allowed in Master Reports and custom reports"
