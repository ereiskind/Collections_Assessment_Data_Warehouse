# User Stories by Role

## As an e-resources library associate...
- responsible for collecting usage stats, I want the system to generate emails to the vendors that don't provide COUNTER stats so that I don't want to send each email individually.
- responsible for collecting usage stats, I want the system to use SUSHI to collect COUNTER reports so that I don't need to manually download the reports.
- I want the system to store all usage stats so that I can create custom cross-platform reports without copying and pasting from multiple spreadsheets.
- I want the system to automatically sum up the e-resources usage numbers requested by ARL and ACRL/IPEDS so that I don't need to create additional workbooks to get these numbers.
